# DustCollection
A collection of components to be used in dust collection systems.

This is designed to use 4 magnets in the printed magnetic vac port, and 4 in the plywood attachment for the CNC. Use .472" "Master Magnetics" brand .118" thick 4.5lb pull neodymium magnets.

The hinges use common 1/4-20x3" bolts, and 3 washers each (top, bottom, and between the hinges).
Intended to be used with inexpensive off-the-shelf plastic dust shoes from amazon.

The dust arm is made with 3/4" cheap home depot ply, and the CNC router vac port mount uses 12mm baltic birch plywood (we used what we had).

The small curved plates are intended to help support 4" dryer ducting and keep it from slipping or rolling off the top of the arm.
